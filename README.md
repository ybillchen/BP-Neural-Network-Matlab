# BP-Neural-Network-Matlab

## Description

BP neural network in Matlab.

## Tutorial

The program is used to generate and train a BP neural network with the primary application of Matlab. I choose Sigmoid as the activation function of the hidden layer, and Linear function as the activation function of the output layer.

Before running the program, you should add all the files into Matlab path. It is recommended to run the program in` BPtrain.m` unless you want to improve my code.

You can change the training set, number of neurons in hidden layer, learning rate, repeat times and check interval in `BPtrain.m` by simply changing the default values.

If your input size and output size are both one, you can run `film.m` to generate a film showing the training process. An example is given below.
